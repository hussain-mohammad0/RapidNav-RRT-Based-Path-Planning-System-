# RapidNav: RRT-Based Path Planning System

RapidNav is a **path planning system** that uses the **Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)** algorithm to efficiently navigate complex 2D and 3D environments. It generates safe and feasible paths for autonomous robots, ensuring optimal navigation even in dynamic spaces.

## Features

- RRT path planning in 2D and 3D environments  
- Tree expansion and goal-directed growth  
- Collision detection and avoidance  
- Trajectory extraction for autonomous navigation  
- Supports dynamic obstacles and complex maps
